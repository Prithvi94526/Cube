For the "About" section (the small text box on the right side of your GitHub repository) and your README, you want a description that is both professional and technically accurate.Here is exactly what you should put:1. For the "About" SidebarKeep this under 160 characters so it doesn't get cut off in search results.A Java-based 3D geometry engine for cube modeling, utilizing triangular meshes, vector mathematics, and first-principle coordinate systems.2. For the Project Description (README.md)You should use a more detailed breakdown here to explain the logic of your code to anyone viewing the project.# CubeA low-level 3D modeling implementation in Java that constructs and manages a cube model using a triangular mesh architecture. Instead of relying on high-level graphics libraries, this project implements the mathematical foundations of 3D space from scratch.Core FeaturesManual Mesh Construction: Defines a cube not just as a box, but as a collection of faces composed of individual triangles.Vector Mathematics: Includes custom logic for UnitVector calculations, essential for determining surface normals and spatial orientation.Granular Coordinate System: Uses a Point class to manage 3D vertices ($x, y, z$) for precise object manipulation.How it WorksPoints: Defines the vertices in a 3D coordinate system.Triangles: Connects three points to create the smallest flat surface unit.Faces: Groups two triangles together to form one of the six square sides of the cube.Cube: Assembles the faces into a complete 3D object.
